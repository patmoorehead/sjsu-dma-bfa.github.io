    <!-- Artist Bio:
  Suhayla’s primary focus of work is to give insight into the human psyche in a world with increased consumption of technology and mass media using digital mediums and her own experiences. She conceptually focuses on the relationship shared between the real world and the virtual world. Utilizing technology to creatively rethinking older ideas and concepts of previous artists and scholars through a new lens. Recent projects by Suhayla approach the dependency of technology and its disruption to people’s functionality and how people view themselves. Resulting in disrupted identities, anxieties, altered memory, and sense of reality.

  Artist Statement:
  My primary focus of work is to give insight into the human psyche in a world with increased consumption of technology and mass media using digital mediums and her own experiences. I conceptually focus on the relationship shared between the real world and the virtual world where our devices are a link between the two. Utilizing technology to rethinking older ideas and concepts of previous artists and scholars through a new lens. In my most recent projects, I approach society’s growing dependency on technology and its disruption to people’s functionality and how people view themselves. Disruptions such as anxieties, altered memory, disrupted identities, and a sense of reality. I often show this disruption using a “glitch aesthetic” in combination with 3D models or Video. -->
