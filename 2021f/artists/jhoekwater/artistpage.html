  <!-- Artist Bio:
  Jordan Hoekwater is a Digital Media Artist studying for his BFA at San Jose State University. Jordan’s work as an artist explores the multi-fascinated manipulation of art processes in multimedia. He has a passion that enables him to quickly learn and adapt within a constantly developing digital world. His goal as an artist is to give my audience insight into perspectives outside of their native views, in the hopes of inspiring new and interesting critiques on the world around us. Utilizing various programs and techniques ranging from 3D animation, to coded processes, Jordan looks to explore the deeper emotional connection that separates the user from the technology defining the two.

  Artist Statement:
  While the internet has created new and efficient ways of communicating around the world, the Pandemic has taught us that the presence of self and identity becomes compromised through a predominantly online world. As humans, we rely on social interactions as a means to communicate and grow on a subliminal level. When taken apart, online interactions become the solution, however it comes at the cost of an interpersonal relationship between emotion and identity.

  As a means to convey the necessity of online interaction brought out by the Covid Pandemic, this digital interface is made to disconnect the user from the sense of separation by giving them an augmented face to face interaction with their own digital identity. Face to face is an interactive reflection on the perceptual disconnection brought out by a socially restrictive environment and explores the interpersonal identity of a skewed presence through the internet. Since it’s initial change, people have been separated from one another to embrace a commercialized form of communication. The device displayed in the exhibition is modeled to be mass produced, utilizing 3D printing, readily available components, and the collaboration between peers. Each device is meant to divide the cognitive disconnection of social presence through online communication by placing the user in a virtual space to experience their own sense of identity through the internet. -->
