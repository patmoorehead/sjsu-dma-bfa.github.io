          I have always been very interested in Japanese traditional culture.
          Including folk legends, ancient buildings such as Torii, Kabuki,
          Japanese Ukiyo-e style, and modern Japanese anime. For the graduate
          exhibition project, I decided to show my love for this culture through
          blender modeling in the form of character design by Blender. The
          character prototype comes from Japanese painters and related documents
          during the Edo period. Online exhibitions require a closed exhibition
          area with Japanese-related Ukiyo-e on the surrounding walls. Although
          I know that the monsters are not real, I am still curious about the
          story behind the monsters. Many monsters are derived from people's
          feelings. So, I think this is also the reason for their fascinating
          existence. I think the most special thing about people is their rich
          feelings. The monsters have evolved because of people's desire, greed,
          love, and sadness. Monsters are not bad, on the contrary, they can
          reflect the bad situation that people were out of at the time or can
          represent many people. And the appearance of a monster is derived from
          people's imagination, and people's emotions are also determined by the
          appearance of a monster. Many Japanese painters have painted ukiyo-e
          of yokai. I love the look of different yokai in the painting, as well
          as the rich colors and unique ukiyo-e style. I will use Mozilla Hubs
          as the platform to present my personal gallery and my models. Monsters
          were a supernatural existence for people at that time. But with the
          continuous advancement of technology, fewer and fewer people will
          believe or be curious about their existence. I hope he will not
          gradually disappear from people's sight, because monsters are also a
          very interesting culture. I know that my current artwork is not so
          mature, or there are many areas for improvement. But I will continue
          to learn and make my work more successful and attractive. I am happy
          to share my artwork with you!
