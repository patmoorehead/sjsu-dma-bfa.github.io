    <!-- Artist Bio:
  Cole Pergerson is a video game designer who creates interactive fiction in virtual worlds. Many of his games are short and fun experiences but his more recent work has become conceptually deeper and presents questions relevant to modern life. He is interested in exploring questions around labor and authenticity. All his games can be found on his Itch.io page, including The Work We Care About, a game that was put featured in the BFA gallery. Cole will graduate with a BFA degree in Digital Media Art at San José State University in Fall 2021.

  Artist Statement:
  The Work I Care About is an interactive text narrative about finding meaningful work. The game centered on issues around authenticity and labor. When the player interacts with the story, they will make decisions about work, education, and passion. All three elements are important for determining what do in life. I was inspired by own struggle to pursue work that I authenticity cared about, rather than for monetary gain. -->

          The Work I Care About is an interactive text narrative about the
          hurdles of having a fulfilling life while working at a job. This is a
          story where readers can make choices that respond to job
          dissatisfaction and the lack of space to pursue our passions. Every
          choice confronts the viewer to bring in their own notions of labor and
          life fulfillment. Interactivity in this narrative pushes the viewer to
          define their own definition of meaningful work. No one is alone in
          this struggle to achieve a fulfilling life and this story serves to
          create conversations about how work should be involved in our lives.
