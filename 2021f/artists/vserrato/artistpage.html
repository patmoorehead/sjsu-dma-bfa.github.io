    <!-- Artist Bio:
  Victoria Serrato is a Chicana multimedia artist whose digital media artworks encompass illustration and video. Victoria is based in the California Central Valley, adjacent to the San Francisco Bay Area. She is currently a student at San José State University and pursuing a BFA in Digital Media Art. In addition to her work as an artist, she works in video production/editing, graphic design, and social media.


  Artist Statement:
  Growing up in a culture and family steeped in Catholicism, I was exposed primarily to Christian theology and the idea that God (the holy trinity), saints, and divine figures who had the most power were masculine. Coming from a Mexican-American background (where the veneration of La Virgen de Guadalupe can be more important than to that of God himself), but being raised in the United States where this practice was not as common as the worship of the divine masculine was confusing.

  In my own personal religious/spiritual beliefs, I have begun to lean away from the rigid patriarchal values of Christianity, and more towards folk and syncretic based traditions which elevate and celebrate the feminine and androgynous aspects of divinity. As an artist, I am fascinated with the concept and context of culture, whether it be ethnic and national identity, religious identity, or sub cultures.

  This project is a response to the duality of the perception of femininity as weakness, with the strength that feminine deities are capable of inspiring in their devotees, as well as a re-assessment of gendered power in religion. -->
