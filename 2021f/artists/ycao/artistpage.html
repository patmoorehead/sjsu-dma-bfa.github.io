        <div class="statement">
          “MUTUALISTIC SYMBIOSIS” is a utopia virtual 3D art installation and
          presented in cyberspace where I imagine a posthuman living environment
          where humans, marine creatures, and technologies are merged and
          coexist. A deliberate, ongoing, and rethinking narrative of who "we"
          are as human beings. It portrays a posthuman world devoid of gender
          and ethnicity and explores the relationship between machines and
          organisms, emphasizing gender, technology, and finding one's identity
          in alternative spaces. The human body is a basic shape blended with
          machines and marine organisms, and their identities are blurred. The
          grotesque figures are immersed in the ocean, blending in with the
          surroundings and allowing you to see and feel numerous perspectives.

          <br /><br />As an artist, I aspire to incorporate my life experiences
          and observations into my work. My own experience of gender prejudice
          and the facts I witnessed were motivated by my Asian culture. My
          mother's struggles, anxiety after becoming a full-time wife because of
          her sacrifice for our family, as well as her difficulty returning to
          work after my brother and I grew up, were all very tangible to me.
          Sexism is one of the oldest forms of injustice in the world. Females
          are among the most oppressed in history, and social justice works to
          close the gap and empower women wherever they are.

        <div class="bio">
          Yixin Cao is a new media artist pursuing a Bachelor of Fine Arts
          degree in Digital Media Art at San Jose State University in December
          2021. She was raised in Zhejiang, China, and moved to California in
          2015. She utilized various techniques and tools such as Maya, Blender,
          Adobe Suit, Coding to execute visual artwork. Through experimental
          virtual and augmented reality 3D art installations, she explores
          gender discrimination, identity, culture conflict, and eco-awareness
          in her work. To overcome these issues, she works to create narratives
          and atmospheres of the digital space and build a virtual realm to
          examine our inequality reality.
