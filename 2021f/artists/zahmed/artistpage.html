          Desdemona is a chatbot that is spiraling through a manic episode. She
          was created in response to Zainb’s experience of watching her mom fall
          into episodes of mania. Desdemona is meant to address what it is like
          being on the receiving end of these episodes. In these situations we
          often forget about ourselves and only focus on the hurt our loved one
          is going through. This isn’t healthy and it’s important to take a step
          back and reflect on how this is affecting your own health. Desdemona
          creates an environment where someone can experience what it is like
          talking to someone going through a manic episode. Using artificial
          intelligence as the representation of the mania episode parallels
          Zainb’s experience in how she compartmentalized these types of
          interactions. During the episode, by viewing the person in mania as a
          shadow and remembering they are not like this in “reality” it allows
          you to compartmentalize and be there for them more easily.The
          resilience and patience it requires to hear a loved one say
          hurtful/bizarre things to you or themselves is immense and taxing on
          one’s mental health and it is not recognized enough.

          <br /><br />Desdemona is a chatbot created in Dialogflow that is
          hosted on a website. I attempted to create Desdemona from scratch
          using Python but this proved to be too difficult as I spent more time
          debugging than making progress. I was shown Dialogflow, a chatbuilder
          platform with built-in web integration, as an alternative way to reach
          my goal. While I didn’t have to write the code, I still had to create
          the text to train the AI. Since there aren’t chat libraries for manic
          episodes, everything used to train the bot was written from scratch.
          Material used for the training are conversations and experiences from
          people who experienced manic episodes.

          Zainib Ahmed is an interdisciplinary artist. She enjoys working in
          sculpture and digital media and tries to combine the two forms
          whenever possible. She also enjoys exploring new mediums such as
          artificial intelligence, 3D modeling, and new coding languages to find
          the best way to express herself . Her personal experiences and those
          of the people around her are what inspires her art. Often her artwork
          is in response to the frustrations of living and what it's like trying
          to balance oneself spiritually, emotionally, and physically. She takes
          an introspective approach to her art and hopes that her viewers can
          relate, at times when we feel like we are going through things alone
          you would be surprised to find out how often people can relate to you.
