          For as long as I can remember I have used digital media as a method of
          escape from reality. Whether it be to spend time on myself, connect
          with others, or simply some reprieve from the struggles of everyday
          life, digital mediums like social media and video games have been my
          method of escape. Many others use these mediums the same way I do,
          especially when faced with challenges like we face today with
          quarantine due to a global pandemic. With this in mind, I seek to
          create a space that pays homage to these mediums. Specifically I will
          focus on video games, social media, and film, as these are the most
          popular and prominent in our current everyday life. By creating an
          interactive traversable environment, I aim to introduce other digital
          media formats that people may not be experienced with, while also
          creating familiar spaces for those that are.

          Patrick Moorehead is an interdisciplinary artist whose work focuses on
          environment design in three dimensional digital spaces. His influences
          range from growing up playing video games, watching animated movies,
          as well as drawing inspiration from everyday life. He has worked in a
          variety of mediums both physical and digital including ceramics, glass
          work, painting, and sculpture, but his main passion is in three
          dimensional spaces and digital design. By working in digital media he
          is able to fully express himself without worry of material
          limitations. Patrick began his art practice during his time at Diablo
          Valley College before transferring to San Jose State University and
          will be graduating with a Bachelors of Fine Arts degree in Digital
          Media Art in fall of 2021.
