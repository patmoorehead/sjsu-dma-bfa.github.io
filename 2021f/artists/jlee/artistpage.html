  <!-- Artist Bio:
  Johnny Lee is a Digital Media Artist from Morgan Hill, stringing artworks into narratives about communication, virtual interconnectivity, and relationship in a surreal and fictional theme. As a student with Asperger's Syndrome, he perceives the subtle and sudden changes of social interactions in-person and virtually. Thus, he creates a series of work relating to audiences interacting and observing the dramatic changes utilizing digital art, websites, video games, video art, sculptures, and 3D animation. His artwork is a reflection of his experiences through cultures, community, imagination, and storytelling.
  
  Artist Statement 
  "As Sensorial Beasts are..." is a series of 3D animation and digital artworks covering Autism Spectrum Disorder's subtopic on social interactions and perception in a virtual setting. With the increasing usage of online and virtual connections, people are bound to link to narratives and information. However, people diagnosed within the Autism Spectrum Disorder tell a different story, involved to change themselves into a representation or an avatar. Through their personas, they can express themselves as beings beyond their humanity while introducing parts of their personality and identity to their peers. This exhibition expands and explores this topic by guiding audiences into a unique virtual wilderness: the forest and the cavern. Outside, there will be colorful beasts with various personalities, drawing viewers to observe and appreciate their social natures. The subterranean passage covers the mixed ambiance of the internal mental workings of how these beasts interpret the dangerous realities of their worlds. The exhibition works as an anthology, allowing audiences to focus on a specific artwork as its own narrative realm.

  Inspired by the fandoms, social media, and my past experiences, I tackle the personal journey of people with Autism venturing through the virtual life as beasts. These ‘beasts’ are connected to this community called “furries”, people who represent themselves as animals and creatures as their alternate personality and celebrates various cultures and media under its name. A good percentage of people diagnosed with Autism have at least some connections with furries. Thus, there are many psychological and emotional changes undergoing and linking how Autistic people create their own personas and represent themselves or a completely different character. However, this kind of escapism can differ drastically in stress thanks to the recent negativity of Covid-19’s pandemic. Social media and VR games force furries to work with their digital limitations, creating 3D models of their personas, digital artworks, and other forms of creative content but as euphoric as it sounds, the digital world is still as dangerous and damaging to their mentality and physicality. I believe this exhibition will bring new light to how we perceive not just Autistic people under the furry fandom but all Autistic people. There are times when they get creative and develop a healthy lifestyle with the right people and support and others when horrible decisions and degeneracy cripple their reputation and mindset. Behind their quirky nature comes a developing story how they became beasts. -->
