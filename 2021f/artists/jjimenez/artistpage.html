  <!-- Artist Bio:
  Jorge Jimenez is a web artist that likes to focus on making interactive web art through programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently he is pursuing his BFA in Digital Media Arts at San Jose State University. Growing up he was fascinated with the interaction with video games, he wants to bring that same type of interaction but within a website. With the internet getting easier to access, putting interactive work on a website will be easier for his audience to interact with his art. As he learned to code, he became fascinated by manipulating the code to make something abstract on a website. He is currently working in abstract art, specifically something that looks like a glitch, combining his skills with web art and glitch art to make something abstract on a website. Other areas of expertise are in 3D modeling, illustrating, and many other types of digital mediums. He intends to keep making work that will have his audience interact with and be immersed in his art.

  Artist Statement:
  As a digital media artist, I have vast knowledge in many types of mediums in the digital realm. But the main medium I like to work with is web art specifically combining web design with glitch art. My style of work is close to what abstract artists would do but in this instance in web design. I prefer to make work that looks interesting and has no meaning to it, something that will catch someone's attention or keep them looking through the website. As I have started learning more about web design, I have also gotten fascinated in interactive art through websites. Growing up I played many video games and because of this it has made me want to make work where people can interact with it. Not specifically games but web art that will get someone hooked to explore the website. In video games there is something called an “Easter Egg” where players look around to uncover secrets. I want to have this same feeling but through a website in the future. Web art is perfect for this because as technologies advance so does the medium and new art will come out of it. For the meantime glitching work in my eyes has been one of the ways where it can catch someone’s eyes and be interested in the art. I want my art to abstract and to get people to interact with it. As we move forward with technology many artworks are going to be more accessible and I want my art to be like that from the start. -->
