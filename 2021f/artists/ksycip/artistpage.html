    <!-- Artist Bio:
  Kyra SyCip seeks to create art that brings light into the world rather than the ever-present
  darkness that we are consumed by on a daily basis. SyCip has contributed to works such as an online 3D exhibit of Wafaa Bilal’s Canto III as well as an online interpretive exhibit of Hito Steyerl’s Factory Of The Sun, all of which were during her time as a student at SJSU. SyCip is currently a BFA student in Digital Media Art at San José State University. She works in Digital Media with a professional focus in Digital Design and Marketing

  Artist Statement:
  Angkong is an online interactive exhibition and tribute to my late grandfather, Samuel Tan
  SyCip (1939-2019). Through this work my deepest hope is for viewers to have a glimpse into the extraordinary life of my grandfather, or as I call Angkong. Despite facing great adversities and trials there was always one constant in his life that never ceased, his faith in Jesus Christ. His unwavering faith moved mountains and inspired so many even to this day. As his granddaughter, it is a privilege and an honor to use my skills and talents I’ve learned from the last four and a half years in dedication to him and to this final work I will do as a student. May this work honor him and his legacy as it continues to share not only who he was and is to me, but also to Whom he dedicated his life to. -->
