    <!-- Artist Bio:
  Prajwol Bhandari is a contemporary 3D artist who lives and works in San Francisco, CA. A native of Kathmandu, Nepal, his works play with the nostalgic memories of his home country. His artwork focus on an innovative method of producing 3D objects as well as VR environments inspired from his roots to fit modern society. “I love to create scenes as I constantly imagine a certain scenario,” he has said. “I then using digital platform make that environment into reality”. Influenced by Tim Hawkinson’s obsession with his own body, Prajwol also tends to manipulate his own body to create something new and unique to his viewers. Apart from 3D modeling, Prajwol also makes sculptures that are abstract and religious.

  Artist Statement:
  My work focus on digital 3D works that connect with the viewers accordingly to their perception of their surrounding. My practice is interesting because I relate my works with my own body and environment. I mostly use 3D software to create 3D models and VR environments. I research the assets in order for me to manipulate the object to give it a new meaning. Also, I use found material and textures to give it a known existence to the objects I create. “Perception of Robots”, 2021, is one of my latest works that play with the idea of robots viewing us in about 100, the humans as something that is a lazy matter in existence. So, to convey this message of robots/AI being in charge of the world, I intentionally created an unsolvable Rubix cube, a photo of a just drone in nature, and a 3D scan of myself but with steel texture. Here Rubix cube gives logical aspects and the picture of the drone hint at the viewer something with Robot, which otherwise explained are hard to see. I spent the whole summer of 2021 analyzing and contemplating the possible ways to represent the geographic of Nepal in my next artwork. After a series of terrain building, I decided to divide the terrain into three sectors with a decrease in elevation respectively. The first sector with top elevation worked as the mountains region of Nepal with a little replica of Mt.Everest. The second sector is a hilly region with lots of forest area. The final sector is the Terai region which is almost flat terrain to represent agricultural land. This work is called “GETAWAY”, 2021. Similarly, in “Longway”, 2018, I wanted to portray my surrounding, in this case, the highway which I was using frequently to travel from one community college to another. Also, part of my body incorporates my experience during that time. So, I created a sculpture of my lungs and painted it with black and yellow color to make the highway in between.

  I love putting objects from the real to the virtual world as it gives us more freedom to do anything with them. So, I 3D scan models from my surroundings which I find interesting and useful down the road. Then I use those objects as assets for the environment or manipulate them to change the meaning of the objects. I 3D scanned myself sitting down which I then using 3D modeling software cut the half part of my head and attached a flower vase. This work acts as my personal vase which I then 3D printed. I like to create some sort of missing piece in my works but the hints are always within the artwork. So, I want my viewers to have some fun and come up with their own iteration of ideas about what the work. -->
