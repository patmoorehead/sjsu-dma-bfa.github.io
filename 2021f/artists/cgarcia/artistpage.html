  Artist Statement:
  One with Drums is a tribute to all those times I wish I had my own set of drums. I wanted to have the space to be able to create my own sound. Being able to play the drums becomes a feeling you do not want to lose. When playing the drumset your whole body is moving and you feel the music in every inch of your body. You are the one controlling it.
  The piece consists of a 3D model of a drum set on a stage and as you walk to it there are past and present video clips of me playing the drums. You will be walking as if it was a hall of fame and going through past accomplishments to the new accomplishment. There will be sound filling up the room and as you approach the pieces as well. Take in these steps and become One with Drums. -->
