    <!-- Artist Bio:
  Jose Tovar is a digital media artist pursuing his Bachelor of Fine Art degree in Digital Media Art at San Jose State University. Jose focuses in the realms of 3D software and web development. His recent works have dealt with Blender and game engines such as Unity3D. In Blender, he’s able to create characters and locations for his scenes. These creations are usually transported into Unity in order to create playable animated games in both 2D and 3D formats. One of his current works entitled Living Dead is a game created using Unity and programming aspects involved in order to animate the scenery. By doing so, Jose is able to create mini-games showcasing his passion for creative programming.

  Artist Statement:
  Mental health is a major topic that affects 1 in 4 adults in the US. It’s a subject that shouldn’t be forgotten about and taken seriously. My work is an examination around the topic of mental health and ways to heal it in a natural way. I created a 3D world with two opposing settings that involve an anxiety-inducing location and a more calming location, leading the player to a place where they can heal mentally. I use this calming section of the world to showcase the healing and soothing effects that nature can offer for your mental health. -->
