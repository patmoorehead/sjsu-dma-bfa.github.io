          My artistic practice encompasses areas of graphic development 
          and editing software in digital media, as well as the inclusion of 
          traditional methods. Over the course of my career, I aimed to create 
          engaging artwork that educated and inspired the public by broadening 
          their views of different artistic styles and approaches. However, 
          on most occasions, my art is purely a form of self-expression or a 
          reflection of my past experiences. Through the manipulation of digital 
          methods, like illustration or 3D modeling in programs such as blender, 
          I construct pieces adorned in vibrant colors and fantastical imagery. 
          Digital art is one of the only ways I can manifest my creative mind 
          because it can only exist as a virtual piece. However, there are times 
          where I do prefer to experiment with traditional practices. “Wallflower” 
          was a physical sculpture that was created by combining new materials with 
          repurposed garbage, or damaged goods. It was a piece that symbolized the 
          unwanted attention aimed at one that experiences social anxiety. Another 
          work that dealt with a heavy topic was “Identity Monster” – an exploration 
          of the life of a queer individual experiencing gender dysphoria and 
          identity crises. It acted as both a spatial and digital piece as it was 
          a series of photoshopped images of a miniature diorama I made. Creating 
          such work all become very personal to me as I try to incorporate some 
          details of my own issues or life in every piece. This way, a small part 
          of me lives in my artwork and I can continue to exist even when I no 
          longer do. 

          <br /><br />As mentioned previously, I aim to educate and inspire my audience through 
          my artwork, and although my work is open to interpretation, every piece holds 
          a meaningful message that should be read. As artists, we have the ability to 
          move the masses with art, so why not fabricate the piece that can assist, 
          inspire, and change our everyday lives. During my educational pursuits, I aimed 
          to become an artist that could specialize in different disciplines so I can use 
          various programs and resources to freely express my creative mind. I then realized 
          the vast potential we students have specializing the field of digital media. As 
          a digital artist, you create something that only exists as a form of data; something 
          that is timeless, permanent, and can exist so long as technology never dies.

        <div class="bio">
          Mary Dominguez is a digital media artist whose work revolves around 
          digital illustration, photo and video editing, and 3D modeling, as 
          well as more traditional practices like sculpting and mixed media. 
          Art for them is an outlet that fabricates the macabre, obscure 
          realities of the mind, often incorporating aesthetics that are 
          charming but chaotic in nature. Most pieces often deal with heavy 
          undertones that tie with social activism, mental health, and the 
          representation or identity of the human body. Recently in their career, 
          they’ve been experimenting with different themes such as futuristic 
          ideologies. With their educational background regarding transhumanism and 
          digital history, Dominguez aims to incorporate these new approaches 
          into their latest work.
