  <!-- Artist Bio:
  Julie Wei is a Cupertino-based digital media artist currently pursuing a BFA Digital Media Art degree at San Jose State University. Her works range across a spectrum of digital mediums, from programming and 3D modeling to 2D illustrations and games. A recurring theme across many of her works involves drawing inspiration from fairytales and/or other subjects of whimsy and inserting a different spin to the material, oftentimes with dark undertones. Through her art, Wei hopes to introduce an element of childlike playfulness to the world as well as call attention to intriguing works that have been created throughout the span of human existence and cater them to new audiences.
  
  Artist Statement:
  Children are taught at a young age that dreams are the manifestation of one’s subconscious thoughts. Yet, what if one’s dream was instead used to better understand others, or at the very least evaluate their morals?
  Introspection is a narrative based upon a dream of Wei’s that still lingers on the precipice of her mind to this day, no less attributed to its open-ended nature. Her desire to bring it into being originated from when she first recounted the tale to a few friends which in turn spurred on an interesting discourse over what each of them would do if confronted with the situation in question. Fascinated with how others would react in the same circumstances, she thus decided to base her piece on this dream.
  Stylistically, Wei chooses to format Introspection to be a 2D animation in first-person perspective because she desires for the artwork to be an immersive experience whereupon the viewers can empathize with and put themselves in the position of the characters. This is done in the hopes that they can, in the end, better evaluate their choices. It is in this same line of reasoning that Wei also opts to forgo dialogue and subtitles in her video since this absence of words would require the viewers to fill in the gaps with their own personalities and speech.   -->
