          "The Wander Land" is a game made in Blender and Unity. This game is a walking
          game of free exploration, where there are no rules or routes, and
          players are free to explore the space, following their curiosity and
          direction and eventually leaving their unique traces in the space.

          <br /><br />I believe that the practice of games is unique in that
          games, as one of the unique expressions of the virtual world, can
          vividly present the author's ideas; and, at the same time, create
          different experiences and connections to the outside world. To be able
          to complete the production of this game, Blender and Unity became the
          main tools to realize this game: blender as a tool for building models
          and environments, creating manipulable character models and scene
          changes for me, and Unity as a tool for giving models in-game behavior
          and connecting character models and scenes. As a result, I was able to
          work independently on the framework and content of a game. It is very
          fulfilling to create a model and a game that fits the idea. For me,
          starting from a sphere and slowly fabricating characters, objects, and
          environments, this sense of enrichment and achievement from nothing to
          something is enriching my experience and experience. Of course,
          character and object models need to be created slowly, and the faces
          and lines in the models need to be well orchestrated and placed to
          achieve the desired effect. On the other hand, Unity makes the
          characters move and provides a real sense of interaction between
          reality and the virtual. To achieve these results, rigor and focus are
          essential requirements, as overlooking a single detail may cause me to
          keep redoing and fixing bugs.

          <br /><br />All in all, this game project was enough time and effort
          to complete, and although it may not always be perfect in terms of
          play, it was exciting and unique enough to allow me to grow in the
          practice of the game. Currently, I think game practice is one of the
          ways to create virtual space nowadays. With the help of Blender and
          Unity tools, it allows me to produce more features and effects on
          games. Furthermore, by being in this game space, players can feel that
          no matter how to move forward and explore, they will leave their
          traces in this space.
