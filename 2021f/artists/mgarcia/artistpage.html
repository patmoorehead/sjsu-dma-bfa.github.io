  Artist Statement:
  The goal behind every single one of my personal and professional projects is to convey a positive message.I enjoy the outcome of every one of my personal projects and collaborated /professional projects. I also enjoy giving out some of my resources to the public in such platforms as github so others can get an idea of how a project can be done.
